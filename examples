# üß© For your case (Product Customizer App):

# Your scopes make sense:

# read_products, write_products: Needed to show/edit product data.

# read_orders: Needed to check past custom orders (optional but fine).

# write_draft_orders: Required for your custom pricing and custom line items logic.

# read_checkouts, write_checkouts: Useful for checkout integration (but avoid altering Shopify checkout beyond limits).

# read_script_tags, write_script_tags: Needed for injecting your frontend widget into storefronts.

# ‚úÖ So this list is Shopify-acceptable for a legitimate product customizer app.


#--------------------------------------

# üü° Recommendation:

# When submitting the app for review, add short explanations in your app submission form like:

# write_draft_orders: Used to create draft orders with custom pricing for personalized products.

# write_script_tags: Used to inject our custom product customizer widget on storefront product pages.
# Suggested Explanation for App Review:

# write_script_tags ‚Äì This scope is used to automatically inject our customizer JavaScript (config.v2.js) into the store‚Äôs product pages when the app is installed.
# The script adds the ‚ÄúCustomize‚Äù button and enables the product customization workflow without requiring the store owner to manually edit their theme or add any files.
# This ensures a seamless setup and proper functioning of the product customizer app on the storefront.



#KR Customizer requires read_orders and write_draft_orders to link customized products to customer orders and create draft orders for a smooth checkout experience. read_products and write_products are used to access and update product metadata for customization, while read_script_tags and write_script_tags manage frontend scripts dynamically. All customer and order data is handled securely over HTTPS, with no sensitive payment information accessed or stored. The app fully complies with Shopify‚Äôs privacy requirements, and a Privacy Policy is provided.
